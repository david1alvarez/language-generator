# language-generator

I am a service for creating a language based on given phonemes and an input text.

Currently it is keyed to the analysis by Craig Daniel phonemes of Tolkein's Black Speech, [A SECOND OPINION ON THE BLACK SPEECH](https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/blackspeech.htm)

To start, run `npm run build`, then `npm run translate "[text to translate]"`
